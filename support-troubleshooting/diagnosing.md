# Diagnosing #

Here are some instructions to assist in diagnosing your issue(s) which you should evaluate and attempt before creating a topic on our support forums.

## Plugin Compatibility ##

Some plugins may not be compatible with DMS due to conflicts in code. In order to diagnose if a plugin is causing an error, navigate to your **Wordpress Administrator Dashboard &rarr; Plugins**.

1. Deactivate ALL plugins
2. Re-visit your website and check to see if the issue persists

If the issue does not persist, one (or more) of your plugins is causing a conflict with PageLines DMS. To determine which plugin(s) is causing the conflict, follow these steps:

1. Activate each plugin one by one
2. Check to see if the issue returns after each plugin is activated

## Javascript Error(s) ##




## Next Step ##

By following these guidelines you may indentify the cause of your issue yourself. If this isn't the case, don't panic. Providing this information when creating your forum topic, will greatly help our support staff identify the cause of your error(s).
